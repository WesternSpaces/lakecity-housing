# Bi-Weekly #21 — Meeting Prep Notes
**Date:** February 23, 2026, 2:00 PM
**Status:** Final bi-weekly meeting

---

## Agenda Item 1: Plan Adoption — Congratulations!

**The plan was adopted February 18, 2026 by both the Town Board of Trustees and the Board of County Commissioners.**

### Talking Points
- Both boards adopted unanimously on the same date — this is a strong signal of alignment
- Public comment period (closed Jan 31) received 1 letter of support, no opposition
- Website is updated and live at lakecityhousingstrategy.com:
  - Adoption language replaces all draft/comment-period language
  - Correct final PDF posted (Feb 11 version with "About This Plan" disclaimer page)
  - Link to Town's official page at townoflakecityco.gov
- Town also has the plan posted at their own URL: https://www.townoflakecityco.gov/lake-city-hinsdale-county-comprehensive-housing-plan

### Website Discussion
lakecityhousingstrategy.com is currently hosted via GitHub Pages (maintained by Western Spaces). Options going forward:

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Keep as-is** (Western Spaces maintains) | No work needed, archive stays accessible | Ongoing dependency on Western Spaces |
| **Redirect to Town's official page** (simplest) | Clean long-term, single source of truth | Loses meeting archive and materials |
| **Transfer repo/hosting to Town** | Full local control | Requires someone to manage GitHub |

**Recommendation:** Redirect is simplest long-term since the Town already hosts the plan. Western Spaces can set up the redirect.

## Agenda Item 2: IGA Next Steps

**Both boards adopted → green light to begin drafting the Intergovernmental Agreement.**

### Talking Points
- IGA formalizes the Town-County partnership: roles, responsibilities, cost-sharing, and priorities
- From the Silverton model, a typical IGA is 5–15 pages covering:
  - Cost-sharing formula (e.g., 50/50 split)
  - Staff supervision and reporting structure
  - Property ownership provisions
  - Decision-making authority for projects
  - Term and termination provisions
- IGA should be in place **before** hiring coordinator (it defines supervision structure)

### Who Drafts?
| Option | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Town attorney** | Closest to day-to-day operations |
| **County attorney** | May have more bandwidth |
| **Consultant support** | Sarah/Western Spaces can review drafts |

- DOLA can provide example IGAs from other small communities — ask Robin DeFalco
- Silverton's advice: "Keep the IGA simple initially; can amend as you learn"
- Starting grant applications immediately after HA formation worked well for Silverton

### Key Decision Needed
- Who takes the lead on drafting? Town or County attorney?
- Target: Spring 2026 execution

## Agenda Item 3: Housing Coordinator

### DOLA Grant
- Up to **$75K/year** through Local Planning Capacity Grant
- Rolling application window, Spring 2026
- **Applicant question:** County may be better positioned as lead applicant (Town currently closing out its DOLA grant)
- Contact: **Robin DeFalco**, DOLA Regional Manager

### Bridge Funding
- Fast-track incentive funds already secured: **$100K** ($50K Town + $50K County)
- Can fund coordinator Year 1 if DOLA timing is slow
- This gives flexibility — don't have to wait for grant approval to get started

### Silverton ROI
- $60K coordinator salary → $1M+ in grants secured (17:1 return)
- Coordinator is 0.75 FTE, housed in San Juan Development Association
- Funded by DOLA REDI grant for first 3 years

### Coordinator vs. Consultant (Grant raised this previously)
| | Coordinator | Consultant |
|---|-------------|-----------|
| **Relationship** | Embedded, ongoing | Project-based |
| **Knowledge** | Builds institutional knowledge over time | Brings outside expertise |
| **Grants** | Manages grant pipeline long-term | Writes specific grants |
| **Cost** | $60–75K/year (can be grant-funded) | Varies by project |

**Recommendation:** Coordinator for long-term capacity. Consultant for specific technical needs.

### Open Items from Feb 9
- **Michelle/Town was continuing DOLA discussions with Dana and Robin DeFalco** — get update
- What coordinator models did Robin suggest?
- Has Town made progress closing out current DOLA grant?
