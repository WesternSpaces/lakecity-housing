## 4. Immediate Action Items (Phase I: Now–6 Months)

These actions should begin immediately after plan adoption. They are listed in recommended priority order.

| # | Action | Owner | Target | Dependencies | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | ~~**Adopt Housing Plan**~~ | Town Board + County Commissioners | Feb 18, 2026 | None | **COMPLETE.** Adopted Feb 18, 2026 by both boards. |
| 2 | **Execute IGA** | Town + County attorneys | Spring 2026 | Plan adoption | Formalizes partnership, roles, cost-sharing. Cannot finalize until plan is adopted by both boards. |
| 3 | **Establish Housing Trust Fund** | Town + County | Spring 2026 | Plan adoption | Needed to receive and manage any revenues (incentive funds, future mill levy, grants). |
| 4 | **Apply for DOLA coordinator grant** | County (recommended lead) | Spring 2026 | Town must close out current grant first | Contact Robin DeFalco at DOLA for models and requirements. |
| 5 | **Hire Housing Coordinator** | Joint (per IGA) | Summer 2026 | DOLA grant + incentive funds | 0.5–0.75 FTE. Silverton model: $60K coordinator → $1M+ in grants (17:1 ROI). |
| 6 | **Form Housing Authority** | Town | Spring–Summer 2026 | None (but easier with coordinator) | $2–5K legal setup. Trustees serve as Board. Unlocks CHFA, LIHTC, Prop 123 benefits. |
| 7 | **Begin acquisition opportunities** | Town + County | Ongoing | Trust fund established | Use Prop 123 funding for land banking and acquisition/rehab. |

## 10. The Four Strategies at a Glance

For quick reference, the plan is organized around four core strategies:

**Strategy 1: Policies & Incentives**
Fast-track permitting, ADU ordinance, STR regulation, long-term lease incentives. *Remove barriers to building and retaining housing.*

**Strategy 2: Optimize Existing Housing Stock**
Acquisition/rehabilitation, housing preservation fund, anti-displacement protections, down payment assistance. *Get more out of the 72% seasonal/vacant housing.*

**Strategy 3: Sustainable Revenue**
Mill levy (primary), inclusionary zoning fees, grant leverage, employer partnerships. *Fund implementation with predictable, sustainable revenue.*

**Strategy 4: Strategic Development & Land Banking**
Lake Fork site (20–28 units), land banking via Prop 123, employer partnerships, public-private partnerships. *Build new housing where it makes sense.*
